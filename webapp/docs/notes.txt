# auth

Users are identified by a jwt token. We have a somewhat special functionality, that any initial page load generates an anonymous user, who can immediately interact with the website. They can choose to log in, which will replace the initial anonymous user, or they can continue browsing the site and interacting. Anonymous users are obviously given a much lower value in our algorithms that estimate actual participation.

1)user loads the frontend, possibly from a completely static cdn

2)frontend sees that localStorage.user is undefined

3)POST /get_free_user_id
	1)atomically gets+inc's free_user_id on server
		either directly in database, or from some assigned range (in case of multiple servers)
	2)returns a signed "i am user 123"

...that's kinda "it". Hasura will accept the token.
...
4)auth0 returns a signed "yes this is xxx", or "yes this is xxx@gmail.com"
5)frontend stores this in the db

	login box/row - "log in / [log in with...] (or just social icons),
	- red or green header

	tooltips - dev options - settings menu

	editable whole campaign/cause as text? This would "solve" full collaborative editability, and open doorway to distributed operation at the same time

		- and we absolutely have to tap into this / hijack, this - the current way things are organized, that is, by plaintext posts on social media

		so probably a default simple interface - multiple controls, text boxes, textarea, etc
			- probably already with rich text description editor?
			- also, i'd stay with the idea that the edited object is already persistently saved

		at the bottom will be a button toggling between simple and advanced ui.

		advanced ui:
			just one rich text editor - "social media format" - the format specifies all the relevant details like minimum participation threshold etc, in a plain-text format suitable for posting anywhere

		- somewhere later we can talk about hijacking with the "participation" format

	- crashes
		- update sapper/svelte?

pagination:
	i'd try a simpler scheme:
		client keeps a list of already loaded id's. sends them (maybe as ranges when possible?) as part of the query.
		no "offset", no routing, just the "endless wall".
		initial request is obvious. then maybe on a scroll event, we trigger then next request

● Now you have several ways to use the 'user' role in your Hasura GraphQL queries:

  1. Direct client access:
  const userClient = getContextClientUser();
  const result = await userClient.query(...).toPromise();
  2. Using role-aware helpers:
  // For queries/subscriptions
  const store = queryStoreWithRole({ query, variables }, true); // true = use 'user' role

  // For mutations
  const mutate = mutation(gql`...`, true); // true = use 'user' role

  // For subscribe function
  const store = subscribe(query, variables, true); // true = use 'user' role
