\N	Ahava Dead Sea Laboratories	\n\nImage: Ahava Stolen Beauty Boycott\n\nCODEPINK, the US women's anti-war movement, has launched the 'Stolen Beauty' campaign targeting Ahava Dead Sea Laboratories for its involvement in the occupied territories.\n\nRegular bi-weekly protests in London have resulted in the flagship Ahava store losing it's lease. A number of small independent stores have dropped Ahava from inventory – among them the gift shop at the National Cathedral in Washington D.C.and the U.N. Commissary in Vienna. In 2009, the organisation pressured Oxfam into suspending actress and Ahava spokes model Kristen Davis from publicity work as an Oxfam Goodwill Ambassador in 2009 for the duration of her contract with Ahava.\n\nAhava's labeling practices have been scrutinised by officials in England, the Netherlands, France, and most recently in South Africa, and more than 10,000 people have pledged to boycott the company.

\N	Air France	<p>Air France is the only major airline that continues to ship monkeys to laboratories for experimentation. Primates transported by Air France are frequently taken from the wild and were transported on journeys that could last for more than 30 hours.</p>\n<p>According to PETA, "Primates in laboratories were routinely mutilated, poisoned, deprived of food and water, forcibly immobilized in restraint devices, infected with painful and deadly diseases, and psychologically tormented...Primates suffer from the long and gruelling transport in the cargo holds of planes and in the backs of trucks."</p>\n<p>In March 2020, the campaign group reissued the boycott call:</p>\n<blockquote><p>"Amid calls for increased experimentation on monkeys during the COVID-19 outbreak, PETA is once again telling Air France to stop flying them to laboratories for <a href="https://www.peta.org/blog/yes-laboratories-are-doing-this-to-primates-too/" target="_blank">pointless and deadly studies</a>.</p>\n<p>"Transporting stressed and potentially immunocompromised monkeys, who are poor models of disease in humans, is dangerous and poses a serious public health risk. Experiments on them have failed to lead to cures and treatments for human diseases, and cutting-edge scientists are already conducting human vaccine trials for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus."</p>\n</blockquote>\n	45	\N	8000000000	1	10	f	f	ethicalconsumer.json#2	\N
\N	Amazon	<p>We have called a boycott of Amazon over its outrageous tax avoidance.</p>\n<p>In 2020, we estimated that the UK lost £52 million to Amazon's tax avoidance in 2017. Nothing has changed significantly since. In 2019, Amazon’s key UK business <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/retailers/amazons-uk-tax-just-3-despite-surge-profits">paid just 3% more in tax</a> compared to 2018, despite its pre-tax profits growing by more than 35%.</p>\n<p>In April 2020, the government implemented a 2% “digital services tax” on UK sales of very large companies providing online marketplaces, as well as search engines and social media services. Amazon immediately announced that it would pass it on to the sellers on its site.</p>\n<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/ethicalcampaigns/boycott-amazon" title="Boycott Amazon">our Amazon boycott here</a>.</p>\n	46	\N	8000000000	1	10	f	f	ethicalconsumer.json#3	\N
\N	Barclays	<p>People &amp; Planet are calling on institutions to divest from and consumers <a href="https://peopleandplanet.org/divest-barclays" target="_blank" title="People &amp; Planet - Divest Barclays">to boycott Barclays</a> in the face of its fossil fuel funding. Barclays is the biggest funder of fossil fuels in Europe, providing over $118billion for fossil fuel projects between 2016-2019. Funded projects include the Dakota Access Pipeline, the Trans Mountain pipeline and the Cerrejón coal mine, all known for their serious violations of Indigenous rights. The campaign says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>it's time for them to halt their support for the fossil fuel industry before they drive us over the climate cliff.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In particular, student-led campaigns have called on universities to divest from the company, seeing <a href="https://peopleandplanet.org/divest-barclays#victories" target="_blank" title="Divest Barclays - victories">widespread success</a>. Sheffield, Bristol and Surrey University Students Unions, NUS and Young Labour are all amongst those to have voted in favour of boycotting Barclays.</p>\n	48	\N	8000000000	1	10	f	f	ethicalconsumer.json#5	\N
\N	Beijing Winter Olympics	<p>Human rights groups and political leaders are calling for a boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing over the Chinese Government’s atrocities against Uyghur citizens in the Xinjiang region. The Chinese government is estimated to have held between 1 to 1.8 million people in detention and forced labour camps in the region – the largest internment of an ethnic and religious minority since World War II.</p>\n<p>In September, more than 160 human rights groups wrote to the head of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), urging them to reverse their decision to hold the 2022 Games in China, due to the state’s human rights abuses in Xinjiang, Tibet, Hong Kong and Inner Mongolia. In February, 180 organisations reiterated the call.</p>\n<p>In its letter to the IOC, the coalition of 180 human rights groups highlighted the failure of the 2008 Beijing Games to encourage change in the county, stating:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The IOC refused to listen in 2008, defending its decision with claims that they would prove to be a catalyst for improved human rights. As human rights experts predicted, this decision proved to be hugely misplaced; not only did China’s human rights record not improve but violations increased substantially without rebuke.</p>\n<p>“Now, in 2021, we find ourselves back in the same position with the IOC who are refusing to act despite the clear evidence of genocide and widespread and worsening human rights failures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other organisations are calling for a diplomatic boycott, which would allow players to compete, but would see governments refusing to send high-level officials to the games. Proponents say it could provide <a href="https://www.axios.com/2022-beijing-winter-olympics-boycott-china-759c66df-df19-4f1b-92a1-744b98276dc9.html" target="_blank" title="New geopolitical fears surround 2022 Beijing Olympics">an opportunity to engage</a> with the athletes, sponsors and broadcasters of the games and raise awareness of the issues.</p>\n	49	\N	8000000000	1	10	f	f	ethicalconsumer.json#6	\N
\N	Brazilian Agribusiness	<p>Civil society has long highlighted the role of Brazilian agribusiness, particularly soya plantations and meat farms, in the destruction of the Brazilian Amazon and serious violations of Indigenous rights.

It says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Agribusiness giants in Brazil are stealing indigenous peoples’ land, poisoning them with pesticides, forcing them to live in makeshift camps with soaring rates of malnutrition, disease and suicide, burning down Brazil’s most biodiverse forests, and threatening to wipe out whole uncontacted tribes. The purchase of produce from these suppliers is fuelling Brazil’s genocide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Brazil’s National Indigenous Mobilization (MNI) and <a href="http://apib.info/apib/?lang=en" target="_blank">Indigenous People Articulation</a> have also <a data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1b089411-5bb0-424f-a69f-4fe4b078d610" href="/food-drink/indigenous-communities-brazil-denounce-products-deforestation" title="Indigenous communities in Brazil denounce products of deforestation">called for international solidarity</a> in condemning those companies involved and are being backed by <a href="https://rebellion.earth/" target="_blank">Extinction Rebellion</a> in the UK.

\N	Fortnum and Mason	<p>PETA called for a boycott against Fortnum and Mason for selling foie gras. The luxury food is made from the liver of geese or ducks that have been specially fattened. This is done through force-feeding, using a feeding tube to give the bird corn. Ducks have to be force-fed twice and geese between three or four times a day. Their livers swell up to ten time their normal size, which means that they press against the birds' lungs, causing difficulty breathing.</p>\n<p>In 2012, PETA UK did an undercover investigation into the Sarlat Perigord cooperative, from which Fortnum &amp; Mason's distributor sources foie gras. It says:</p>\n<blockquote><p>These intelligent, gentle birds are condemned to spend the last weeks of their life in small, barren pens, where they are forced to stand 24 hours a day on metal grating as their urine and faeces build up underneath. The geese panic and struggle as they are roughly grabbed by the throat and a metal pipe is forced down their throats so that huge amounts of grain can be pumped into their stomachs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n	60	\N	8000000000	1	10	f	f	ethicalconsumer.json#17	\N
