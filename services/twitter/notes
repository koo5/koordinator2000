# use:

# js -

	if list of hashtags changes
		hysteresis - timer
reconnect stream (or update live..)

# local db 
tweets
----------------
jsonb


cached_hashtag_timespans
----------
since     |      until    |     hashtag




# koordinator db add:

participations table
----------------
entity_uri   |   reference(json? not indexed..)

entities table
---------------
uri    |   nick   |   




threshold - probably should equal number of "participating" twitter users - if you tweet about it, you're probably already doing something, or want to be doing, at any case you're investing some energy.. We'll see how that works out.
