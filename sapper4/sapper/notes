1)user loads the frontend, possibly from a completely static cnd

2)frontend sees that localStorage.user is undefined

3)POST /get_free_user_id
	1)atomically gets+inc's free_user_id on server
		either directly in database, or from some assigned range (in case of multiple servers)
	2)returns a signed "i am user 123"

...that's kinda "it". Hasura will accept the token.
...
4)auth0 returns a signed "yes this is xxx", or "yes this is xxx@gmail.com"
5)frontend stores this in the db

	login box/row - "log in / [log in with...] (or just social icons),
	- red or green header

	tooltips - dev options - settings menu

	editable whole campaign/cause as text? This would "solve" full collaborative editability, and open doorway to distributed operation at the same time

		- and we absolutely have to tap into this / hijack, this - the current way things are organized, that is, by plaintext posts on social media

		so probably a default simple interface - multiple controls, text boxes, textarea, etc
			- probably already with rich text description editor?
			- also, i'd stay with the idea that the edited object is already persistently saved

		at the bottom will be a button toggling between simple and advanced ui.

		advanced ui:
			just one rich text editor - "social media format" - the format specifies all the relevant details like minimum participation threshold etc, in a plain-text format suitable for posting anywhere

		- somewhere later we can talk about hijacking with the "participation" format

	- crashes
		- update sapper/svelte?
